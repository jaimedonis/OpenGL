Another tiny OpenGL-based graphics application template project. This initial version compiles on top of Android Studio's Game Activity template project.

Features:

Physically-based rendering shader
Rudimentary scene graph with basic scene nodes --render object, camera, lighting.
Loads external gltf meshes, with hooks in place for other mesh file formats.
